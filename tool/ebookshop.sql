When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his Ph.D. experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used.

I had taught an introductory computer science\r\nclass using the Java programming language, but I had not found a textbook\r\nI was happy with. For one thing, they were all too big! There was no way my\r\nstudents would read 800 pages of dense, technical material, even if I wanted\r\nthem to. And I didn’t want them to. Most of the material was too specific—\r\ndetails about Java and its libraries that would be obsolete by the end of the\r\nsemester, and that obscured the material I really wanted to get to.\r\nThe other problem I found was that the introduction to object oriented\r\nprogramming was too abrupt. Many students who were otherwise doing well\r\njust hit a wall when we got to objects, whether we did it at the beginning,\r\nmiddle or end.\r\nSo I started writing. I wrote a chapter a day for 13 days, and on the 14th\r\nday I edited. Then I sent it to be photocopied and bound. When I handed it\r\nout on the first day of class, I told the students that they would be expected\r\nto read one chapter a week. In other words, they would read it seven times\r\nslower than I wrote it.', 'Allen B Downey', 'http://localhost/e-bookshop/uploads/file/Think-Java-How-to-Think-Like-a-Computer-Scientist_(1).pdf', '', 1, '2019-04-12 14:27:22'),

All these \r\norganizations exist to achieve pre-determined objectives. They affect our \r\nlives in many ways. Though there are vast differences in their functioning \r\nand approaches, they all strive to achieve certain objectives. It must also \r\nbe noted that organizations cannot achieve the objectives effortlessly. \r\nThey are achieved through systematic effort. Several activities have to be \r\nperformed in a cohesive way. In the absence of systematic and cohesive \r\nperformance of the activities to achieve the objectives, it is no wonder that \r\nthe resources of organizations would be underutilized.
